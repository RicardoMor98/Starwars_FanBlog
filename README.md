# User Stories

### Agile Planning and Development

<br>

At Star Wars FanBlog, our planning and development process is guided by Agile methodologies and principles. While we don't adhere strictly to traditional Agile frameworks like scheduled sprints or scrums, we emphasize flexibility, continuous improvement, and the ability to adapt quickly to changing needs. Instead of focusing on sprints, we prioritize developing epics that align with the core functionalities of the platform, addressing User Stories based on their priority and impact on the user experience.

Our overarching strategy divides the project into three key phases: planning, development (which includes unit and functional testing), and continuous deployment. Documentation is created, reviewed, and updated throughout the entire process, ensuring clear communication and transparency.

Our approach is streamlined: we begin by developing essential features and core functionalities, then progressively tackle more complex aspects and enhancements. We actively engage with user feedback to identify areas for improvement, ensuring the platform evolves in line with the needs and expectations of the Star Wars fan community. This iterative process allows us to deliver a highly responsive and user-centered experience.

We used a project [User stories board](https://github.com/users/RicardoMor98/projects/4) to track progress.

# Methodology

**The Star Wars FanBlog** project follows a methodology inspired by agile principles, fostering collaboration, flexibility, and gradual development. The outlined approach has guided the project's evolution:


### Agile Project Management with GitHub Projects
To streamline project management, GitHub Projects is employed as a central hub. User stories and tasks are structured as GitHub issues, creating an organized workflow. The GitHub project board serves as a visual representation, tracking progress effectively.

### User Stories as GitHub Issues
Transforming user stories into GitHub issues captures user-centric functionalities. These issues interlink with respective user stories, simplifying access to criteria, tasks, and discussions.

### Bug Tracking for Seamless Development
Bugs uncovered during development are documented as GitHub issues, offering insights into each bug's characteristics, impact, and reproduction steps. By hyperlinking these issues in README.md, users can stay updated on bug resolutions and contribute insights.

### Iterative Development Approach
